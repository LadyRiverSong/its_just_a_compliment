## General Information
- This progam is a text-based game that directly challenges norms and understandings of street harrassment. It takes users on a story based journey, and ends with asking how many threats of violence were present in the game.
- The understanding underpining this project is that cat-calling is a threat of violence, as it is often accompanied by acts of real violence. 
- There is a language warning, with one use of a swear word, and the game revolves around the concepts of violence.
